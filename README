Very easy

to compile:
	run make

if u want to clean the directory:
	make clean
		gets rid of *.asm files and *.o files and all executables that were created

to run:
	./ucc <filename>
				where <filename> is a a file with .c on the end and the file is a correct micro-c language file, it contains only micro-c code

to run the assembly:
	ugavac <filename>.asm
				where <filename>.asm is the above filename used with ./ucc without the .c on the end and instead having .asm on the end
				if the prompt is just waiting it means that the ugavac or program is waiting for input, please input a number!

thats it
