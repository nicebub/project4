Very easy

to compile:
	run make

if u want to clean the directory:
	make clean
		gets rid of *.asm files and *.o files and all executables that were created

to run:
	./ucc <filename>
				where <filename> is a a file with .c on the end and the file is a correct micro-c language file, it contains only micro-c code

to run the assembly:
	ugavac <filename>.asm
				where <filename>.asm is the above filename used with ./ucc without the .c on the end and instead having .asm on the end
				if the prompt is just waiting it means that the ugavac or program is waiting for input, please input a number!

thats it


ROB SPRINGER PLEASE READ BELOW

	you told me you could change my grade for the last project if i fixed those errors, i didn't have time to resubmit but i did fix those errors for this program, that i know of..
	you can use this program and run the tests from the previous program on it and will get the same results, plus the *.asm file which isn't needed for the last program

Thanks a lot
